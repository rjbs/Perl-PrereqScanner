# ABSTRACT: something that scans for prereqs in a Perl document

use Moose::Role;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a role to be composed into classes that will act as scanners plugged
into a Perl::PrereqScanner object.

These classes must provide a C<scan_for_prereqs> method, which will be called
like this:

  $scanner->scan_for_prereqs($ppi_doc, $version_requirements);

The scanner should alter alter the L<CPAN::Meta::Requirements> object to reflect
its findings about the PPI document.
